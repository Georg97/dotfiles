# dotfiles
One Dotfile Repo to rule them all

## Nice to have

- [] Terminal UI to Bootstrap whole config as I want it (everytime unique)
- [] Support for private Configs and secrets (e.g. gitconfig, docker, ssh, vpn)
- [] Consider using a dotfile manager (e.g. chezmoi, dotbot). List of managers: https://dotfiles.github.io/utilities/
